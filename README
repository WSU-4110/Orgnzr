This project is meant to be a loose CRM application to help small businesses track appointments and maintain their day-to-day functions. 

Important packages that will be needed to work on the project include Entity Framework Core, ASP.NET.

The original entities included with  the project include an appointment, product, inventory, contacts, and services entities. 

The main architectural style implemented by this project is MVC in which each entity has a model to track necessary fields, a set of views with forms to capture inputs for those
fields and a controller to write the code to the database and to perform other various operations.

This project still needs a way to display appointments in an interactive way such that appointments can be slid in a daily or a weekly view. 
This project still needs a way to create user accounts such that multiple people and companies can access the application separately.
This project still needs a way to assign roles to the different functions to limit a user's ability to access all functionalities within the application.
